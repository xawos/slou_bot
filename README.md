# SLOU_BOT


>ShitLoad Of Utilities underscore bot


Accepts a config file with admin id and bot_api

The bot gets every image it receives and "memes" it, adding text above and below the image

The only configuration available to the user is the text, entered as caption in the uploaded image.

Splitting by ",," will let you choose where the text goes.

example:
    
    One does not simply ,, create memes with SLOU

will result in:

    Too lazy to upload a photo right now


Will implement new things in the future

Eventuall










So long and thanks for all the code:
